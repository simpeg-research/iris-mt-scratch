seed_merge_asc (test program for seed data reading routines)

To compile:  
    o   Edit Makefile to set LIBARIES =  -L<qlib_path>  -L<fiolib_path>
         (<qlib_path> is the directory where the qlib library (a file called libqlib.a) is;
          similarly, libfiolib.a--the file contatining the libfio library--is
          in <lfiolib_path>).  E.g., <qlib_path> = ../qlib ...
          

    o   Type "make seed_merge_asc"  ... the executable should appear

To run:  edit the ascii file called "cf_station"--this file tells the program
which data files to use, where to put output etc.   (NOTE: the same file is used
to pass info to the FT program ... so there are a couple of extra lines here
which are not used in this test program

Here is cf_station file used for one half day of 1 hz data from SAO, starting at the
begining of day 157.

5 156                  <-- line 1 : # of data channels , day of year for sample # 0  **
DATA/shx.157           <-- lines 2 - 6  data file name for each channel, in order
DATA/shy.157           <-- desired  (NOTE:  It will be simplest for my processing
DATA/shz.157           <--           programs if the channels are ordered Hx, Hy, Hz, then all Es.
DATA/sex.157
DATA/sey.157
sp_file                <-- this line not needed here ... leave blank (system parameter file)
SAO_157                <-- output file name


Once this file is edited, just type seed_merge_asc to run.

The result should be the output ascii file SAO_157.  This file will have 6 integers on a
line: sample #, Hx, Hy, Hz, Ex, Ey .   

** NOTE:  The sample # gives samples since 0:00:00 on day 156
(or whatever day is entered on line 1).  To combine data from several FTed time segments
together, it is neccessary to have all time windows start together, be marked with a time, etc.
this is all kept track of in terms of the "sample numbers", relative to some arbitrary
start time.   For purposes of this array, where abolute time is more important 
it might be good to use somthing like day 1 (Jan. 1, 199*) for the zero time.
