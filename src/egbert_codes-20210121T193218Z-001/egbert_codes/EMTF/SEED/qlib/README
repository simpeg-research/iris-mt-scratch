For an up-to-date leapsecond file, see pub/tz* in the FTP site
elsie.nci.nih.gov, in the file `leapseconds'.

The qlib time routines REQUIRE a leapseconds file in order to 
compute time correctly across leapsecond boundaries.

The default place the libries look for the file "leapseconds" is:
	/usr/local/lib/leapseconds
This can be overridden in the Makefile, or at runtime by setting
the environment variable LEAPSECONDS:
	setenv LEAPSECONDS	path_of_leapseconds_file
