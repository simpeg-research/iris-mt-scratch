This directory conatins code to modify the FFT program dnff
to allow for direct reading of mini-seed files:

MAKE DNFF_SEED FROM HERE.  

This requires the following:

(1) Source codes for most of the dnff subroutines, which should
be in subdirectory D ... note that a link to ../../D is in
this directory, so if you install the parent directory SEED
alongside your old dnff directory D, everything should be found.

(2)  Source codes for reading the actual mini-seed files, 
in ../SEED_ASC .  These are the same routines used for input
in the seed-to-ascii translating program.

(3)  Libraries fiolib and qlib.  Correct paths to these
need to be set in the Makefile .  Source code for these libraries
are in SEED/fiolib and SEED/qlib  .   NOTE: these libraries were
obtained from the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory.  They use
a lot of very non-standard fortran (e.g., data structures, built
in date/time functions).  This compiles on a sun running solaris,
(after some changes ... at first it would only work with sunos).
It never worked on an IBM running aix.  Other versions which work
on different platforms might be available from the Seismological Lab.
But I can't promise that these will work properly with dnff_seed.



TO RUN USE THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT 

       dnff_seed -scf_station

where "cf_station" is the name of a file containing # of channels,
and file names for each channel.  See documentation in SEED_ASC for
details on the form of this file ... the same format is required here.
But note that for dnff_seed you do need the system paramter file 
(described in documentation for dnff).  This needs to be set up just
once for each station (as long as the instruments, gains, etc. remain
unchanged).

Note: with the -s<cf_station>  option only one run can be done at a time (in 
contradiction to the general documentation for dnff).
