There are two programs provided here for reading miniseed
files obtained from the Berkeley sesmological laboratory.

1)  seed_merge_asc (in SEED_ASC) reads files for a number of simultaneous
data channels (one per miniseed file) and outputs a multichannel file
in a simple and obvious integer ascii format.

2) dnff_seed : a special version of dnff that reads directly
from a set of miniseed files, and computes an FC file.

dnff_seed requires also the usual dnff subroutines
Install this directory next to D, T etc in EMTF directory and
everything should be easy.

Both dnff_seed and seed_merge_asc need to link to libraries provided
by the seismo lab (in fiolib and qlib).  These libraries are made
for a solaris system.  Source code is provided, but some changes will
be needed to compile on another system (minor for sunos ... probably
impossible for everything else, since the libraries use sun-specific
extensions to fortran)
